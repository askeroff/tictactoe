# Tic Tac Toe

Tic-tac-toe (also known as noughts and crosses or Xs and Os) is a paper-and-pencil game for two players, X and O, who take turns marking the spaces in a 3Ã—3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game.

Coded as part of the **[FreeCodeCamp](https://freecodecamp.com)** curriculum. You can checkout the demo [here](https://askeroff.github.io/tictactoe/).

You will be playing against computer in this game. 
Computer sort of never loses, if I did my job right. And for this I use minimax algorithm.
